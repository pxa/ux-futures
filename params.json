What role will we have in shaping that world? And when we look back at the impact of UX, will it be with pride or regret?\r\n\r\nWe've asked six brilliant thought leaders—each from very different corners of the UX world—to consider the future. Steve Krug, Jesse James Garrett, Nathan Shedroff, Abby Covert, Andy Polaine, and Margot Bloomstein will take you back and forth in time. They'll inspire you to design for the future, and to design the future itself.\r\n\r\n## Cost\r\n\r\nFree! The [Process Experience Architecture group](http://pxa.iu.edu), a team of UX designers working for the Indiana University [UITS department](http://uits.iu.edu/), have generously sponsored both the venue and the conference cost. Just show up and enjoy the conference with fellow design professionals.\r\n\r\n## Location\r\n\r\nThe conference will live stream on a 24 by 18 foot display in the lobby of the Cyberinfrastructure Building.\r\n\r\n![IQ-Wall in the CIB lobby](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/347558/4631093/dc89a44a-53b2-11e4-9914-23996577e3c3.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Parking\r\n\r\nFor those with an IU parking pass, there are A, C, and E parking spaces near the north and east side of the building.
