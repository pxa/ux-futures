# UX Futures Virtual Conference

[UX Futures](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ux-futures-registration-12433112775) is a conference held virtually, and a live stream of this all-day event is available for free, for local design professionals. Even if you can't attend all the sessions, stop by for what you can. 

Wed, Nov 5, 2014  
9:30am–5:30pm

Wrubel Lobby  
Cyberinfrastructure Building  
2709 E 10th St, Bloomington, IN
  
## Description

Once in a while, it's good to put down your wireframes and stylesheets, step back, and consider what's next.

What might design work—and the designed world—look like in 10, 20 or 50 years? What role will we have in shaping that world? And when we look back at the impact of UX, will it be with pride or regret?

We've asked six brilliant thought leaders—each from very different corners of the UX world—to consider the future. Steve Krug, Jesse James Garrett, Nathan Shedroff, Abby Covert, Andy Polaine, and Margot Bloomstein will take you back and forth in time. They'll inspire you to design for the future, and to design the future itself.

## Cost

Free! The [Process Experience Architecture group](http://pxa.iu.edu), a team of UX designers working for the Indiana University [UITS department](http://uits.iu.edu/), have generously sponsored both the venue and the conference cost. Just show up and enjoy the conference with fellow design professionals.

## Location

The conference will live stream on a 24 by 18 foot display in the lobby of the [Cyber Infrastructure Building](http://it.iu.edu/cib/).

## Parking

PARKING

For those with an IU parking pass, there are A, C, and E parking spaces near the north and east side of the building. If possible, carpooling is recommended, as spaces fill quickly in the morning. 
For those without an IU parking pass, day passes can be provided at the cost of $8, which will allow parking at any A, C, and E parking spaces. Please indicate in the comments if you require a day pass.

For those taking the bus, the [6 Campus Shuttle city route](http://bloomingtontransit.com/6-campus-shuttle-and-6-limited-new/) stops along 10th St., near the building.
