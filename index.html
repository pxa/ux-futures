<a name="description" class="anchor" href="#description"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h2>

<p>Once in a while, it's good to put down your wireframes and stylesheets, step back, and consider what's next.</p>

<p>What might design work—and the designed world—look like in 10, 20 or 50 years? What role will we have in shaping that world? And when we look back at the impact of UX, will it be with pride or regret?</p>

<p>We've asked six brilliant thought leaders—each from very different corners of the UX world—to consider the future. Steve Krug, Jesse James Garrett, Nathan Shedroff, Abby Covert, Andy Polaine, and Margot Bloomstein will take you back and forth in time. They'll inspire you to design for the future, and to design the future itself.</p>

<h2>
<a name="cost" class="anchor" href="#cost"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cost</h2>

<p>Free! The <a href="http://pxa.iu.edu">Process Experience Architecture group</a>, a team of UX designers working for the Indiana University <a href="http://uits.iu.edu/">UITS department</a>, have generously sponsored both the venue and the conference cost. Just show up and enjoy the conference with fellow design professionals.</p>

<h2>
